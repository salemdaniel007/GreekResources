			<p>The Greek resources gathered here are mainly an attempt to compile the words that
			appear in Biblical Greek, and their roots. New Testament words are generally identified
			by their numbers in Strong’s Greek dictionary. However, with online access to Liddell
			and Scott’s <i>Greek–English Lexicon</i>, we get a notion of the sense of the words in
			a wider Greek context. We also have access to words that do not appear in Strong’s.</p>
			
			<p>With so many New Testament resources available, the emphasis here falls more on
			integrating the words found in the Septuagint. With continued study, comparing the
			Septuagint with the Hebrew Bible, we find much agreement. The two texts tend to refine
			one another. For example, the Hebrew generally has <i>davar</i> to cover “word”. The
			Greek refines this into <i>logos</i> and <i>rhema</i>. When we read Isaiah 55, we see
			“my word that goes forth from my mouth.” Then in the Greek, we find it resolved into
			the <i>rhema</i> compared to the rain that literally “fathers” the produce.</p>
			
			<p>On the other side of the coin, <em>works</em> is a huge subject. The Greek
			<i>ergon</i> covers a lot of territory. Comparing it in the Hebrew, we find a number
			of different ideas. When the works are finished, in Genesis 2, the Hebrew uses
			<i>melakah</i>. This is directly related to <i>malak</i>, a messenger. From this, we
			get the sense of some famous author’s <em>complete works</em>, a message, or
			possibly a script, that generations of actors strive to perform. In fact, verse 3 ends
			with “works that God created to do.” This is borne out in John 14:10, where we see the
			Father doing his works. It also give us greater insight into Ephesians 2:10. The word
			“workmanship” is actually the Greek form of the English “poem”. We are his poem,
			created on good works that God prepared in advance for us to walk around in.</p>
			
			<p>The discovery of such rich interactions has led to the development of these
			resources. The <a href="https://github.com/openscriptures/GreekResources" target="_blank">project page</a>
			has a quick introduction to the individual files. The
			<a href="https://github.com/openscriptures/GreekResources/blob/master/GreekWordList.md" target="_blank">Greek Word List</a>
			has its own documentation, and the
			<a href="HomeFiles/GreekApp.html">application</a> for looking up the words is on this
			site.</p>
